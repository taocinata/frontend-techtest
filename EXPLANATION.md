Start frontend app with command 
```shell 
node app.js
```
There is two way to connect backend and frontend app

1. We change port to be the same as it is on backend part, to 5000 in app.js
2. We leave port to be 5401 and we start backend application with command 
```shell 
PORT=5401 npm start 
```

CSS need to be valid: svg property fill doesn't exist, so I deleted it and added fill in every path of svg.

There isn't repo on springernature github account so I couldn't fork it. Instead I push this zip file to my account and did all steps after that.
